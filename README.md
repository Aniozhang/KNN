# KNN
K nearest neighbors algorithm

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k-nearest data points to a given query point and predicts the output based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of those neighbors. It's a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm, meaning it doesn't make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution and does not explicitly learn a model during training.
